## Local-Bottom Network (LB) - PyTorch Implementation

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the Local-Bottom Network (LB) as described in the paper.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch [version]
- torchvision [version]
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

### Dataset
The CASIA-B dataset silhouette data was used for training the LB model. [Provide a brief description of the dataset, its source, and any preprocessing steps performed on it]

### Optimization Technique
The LB model was trained using the Adam optimization technique, which is a popular and efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm. Adam combines the advantages of two other methods, namely Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), to optimize the model's parameters.
